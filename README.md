Problem Statement - We are creating an interface for a peer teaching system that can be implemented in colleges. This aims at helping students who have not understood a particular concept of any subject completely. The user will fill in the details of the subject that he/she wishes to study and their time convenience

//12 am
Peer.java basically collecting the data. So the various users are entering their information like their Designation (Teacher or Student),
subject in which they need help or want to teach, which day they are free etc.
Peer_.java helps the user by doing the processing by checking all the conditions and then comes up with a peer who can help the user regarding a particalur subject.

//4 am
The changes which have been done in the code are that now if the user finds more than one peer than he can select from them and the meeting will be fixed with the selected peer. The code takes care of some simple exceptions.

//8am
Exception Handling and a few more cases added in the processes in the previous code

//final submission
In the final code, we have added a feature for the user to choose whether he/she wants to study from a faculty member or they are comfortable with studying from their peers. And again if there are more then 1 options the user can select a particular Peer or Teacher.
